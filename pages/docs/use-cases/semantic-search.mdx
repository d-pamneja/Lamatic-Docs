Enable **natural-language search** across your company’s content — Drive, SharePoint, S3, OneDrive, Google Sheets, and web (via FireCrawl).  
Users ask in plain English, and results come back as **relevant snippets with citations**.

## What this kit delivers
- **Natural language search** across multiple data sources.
- **Relevant results with citations** so users trust answers.
- **Facets & filters** powered by metadata (author, type, date).
- **Enterprise connectors** (Drive, SharePoint, OneDrive, S3, FireCrawl).
- **Secure by design** — respects ACLs; supports audit logs & PII redaction.

## How it works
1. **Ingest & index** – Connect sources, scrape via FireCrawl, chunk + embed with metadata.
2. **Query & retrieve** – Hybrid semantic + keyword search, tuned for relevance.
3. **Rank & present** – Optional re-ranker improves results; snippets + citations are shown.
4. **Stay fresh** – Scheduled syncs + hooks keep results up-to-date.

## Vertical use cases
- **Support portal search** – customers find answers instantly.
- **Internal knowledge hub** – HR, IT, and Legal in one unified search.

- **Developer docs** – APIs, SDKs, runbooks with contextual snippets.
- **Public site search** – power your website’s docs with intelligent search.

## Configuration best practices
- **Chunk size**: 500–800 tokens; 10–15% overlap.
- **Retriever**: k=8; hybrid on when metadata is rich.
- **Freshness**: schedule crawls; trigger re-index on updates.
- **Metadata**: capture author, updated_at, tags for facets.

---

## Success metrics
- **Zero-results rate** (should trend down).
- **Click-through to source**.
- **Helpful / Not helpful ratio (👍/👎)**.
- **Latency** (p50, p95).
- **Coverage** (% of docs indexed).

**How much can it scale?** Millions of chunks; shard by workspace.  
**Multilingual?** Yes — retrieval + ranking support multiple languages.  
**Can we tune ranking?** Yes — boosts, re-rankers, hybrid weights.

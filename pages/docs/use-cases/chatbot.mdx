# RAG Knowledge Chatbot Kit

Turn your unstructured content into a **chat-based knowledge base in minutes.**  
Deploy an AI chatbot that retrieves answers with citations from your company data (Drive, SharePoint, Sheets, S3, Postgres, web via FireCrawl).  

This kit helps teams move from **static documents** to an **interactive assistant** that can onboard employees, deflect customer queries, and unlock knowledge trapped in silos.  
It’s a demo-ready “product clone” you can extend, brand, and ship.

## How it works

1. **Ingest & index** – Connect any content source. Lamatic scrapes, chunks, and embeds docs with metadata.  
2. **Retrieve & ground** – On each query, the retriever fetches the most relevant chunks (k-NN / hybrid).  
3. **Answer & reason** – The assistant generates a grounded, cited response. Optional agentic tools handle multi-step queries.  
4. **Keep fresh** – FireCrawl ensures web + connected docs are re-synced on schedule, so answers never go stale.

## Vertical use cases

- **Customer Support**  
  Deploy on your support site to answer FAQs, refund policies, and troubleshooting queries — reducing human workload while maintaining trust with cited sources.  

- **HR & Employee Helpdesk**  
  Employees can self-serve benefits, compliance, and IT questions, cutting down on repetitive HR ops tasks.  

- **Engineering Assistant**  
  Developers can ask, *“How do I set up the new service?”* and the bot pulls from onboarding guides, RFCs, or runbooks.  

- **Sales Enablement**  
  Keep sales teams sharp by answering questions about competitor features, pricing tiers, or product specs instantly.

## Customization paths

- **Data sources** – Add/remove connectors (Drive, DBs, S3, FireCrawl for web).  
- **Branding** – White-label the web widget or deploy inside Slack/Teams.  
- **Monetization** – Use as a customer-facing premium bot, or offer it as a SaaS add-on.  
- **Adaptation** – Extend with APIs, structured reasoning flows, or domain-specific prompt libraries.  

> Each subpage (like this one) can be cloned, branded, and pitched as a **vertical kit** — support bot, HR bot, engineering assistant, or sales enablement bot.

## Configuration best practices

- **Chunking** – 700–1,000 tokens with 10–15% overlap for balance between recall and cost.  
- **Retriever** – Default k=6–8; enable re-ranker for longer responses.  
- **Context window** – Cap at model-safe token limit; include citations + compact metadata.  
- **Observability** – Capture query traces, source hits, and user feedback (👍/👎).  
- **Safety** – Enable filters for PII redaction, compliance, or internal blocklists.  

---

## Success metrics

- **Answered-with-citation rate** (target ≥ 90%) – Trust indicator.  
- **Helpful ratio (👍)** – Measures user satisfaction.  
- **Deflection rate** – % of queries resolved without escalation.  
- **Coverage** – % of docs indexed and retrievable.  
- **Latency** – First response time (p50/p95).  

> By tracking these KPIs, teams can prove value early and justify expansion.

## Security & governance

- **Row-level security** – Results filtered by workspace/space ACLs.  
- **Audit logs** – Every query, tool call, and citation is logged for compliance.  
- **Data residency** – Configurable per workspace.  
- **Retention controls** – Choose how long interactions are stored.
